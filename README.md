# META Front End Developer Capstone Final Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background
Little Lemon is a fictional restaraurant that wants to integrate their business into the online platform. Currently, Little Lemon website is only able to show website's background and do a mockup of reserving a table. 
 
## Process
This final project includes everything we learnt in the Front End Developer career path by META. That includes learning HTML/CSS, the React framework, testing, creating a UI/UX and others. 

For this FinPro, I started by creating a UI/UX for Little Lemon's website and also the reserving tab. While the Little Lemon's style guide have been provided, we were still given the freedom to style it after a UI/UX research (user persona & user journey).

After being done with the Hi-Fi, I start to create the components and merging the local styles from Figma to React. I start by doing the mainpage then continued with the `/book` route where we can reserve a table.

For the `/book` route, in the table reservation, we had to implement a time checker provided with the date of reservation using useContext which would call a mock-up API to search for the possible time. You could check the implementation in `/src/Booking.tsx`.
